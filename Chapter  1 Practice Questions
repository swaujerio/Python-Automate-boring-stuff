CHAPTER 1 QUESTIONS
1) Operators *, -, /, +
   values 'hello', -88.8, 5

2)variable - spam
  string - 'spam'

3) 3 data types are int, string and float

4) An expression is made up of values and operators.
   All expressions evaluate to a single value

5) The difference between an expression and a statement
   is that in a statement there is some sort of assignment
   of a value to a variable

6) bacon = 20
   bacon + 1
   bacon still has the value 20 because there is no
   re-assignment of a new value to bacon to over-write the
   old value

7)'spam' + 'spamspam' = spamspamspam
  'spam' * 3 = spamspamspam

8) eggs is valid variable since it begins with a letter and
   is not a Python keyaword
   100 is invalid as a variable name because variabel names
   cannot begin with a  number

9) The functoisn for getting the interger, floating-point
   number or string version of a variabel are int(), float()
   and str()

10) 'I have eatern ' + 99 + ' burritos.' causes an error
    because you cannot add an int (99) to a string.

According to www.python.org lsn() return the length or
number of items of an object. The argument may be a sequence
(e.g. a string, byte or a collection such as a dictionary or
 set.


round() -  round(number[, ndigits]) Return the floating point
value number rounded to ndigits digits after the decimal point.
If ndigits is omitted, it defaults to zero. The result is a
floating point number.  Values are rounded to the closest multiple
of 10 to the power minus ndigits; if two multiples are equally
close, rounding is done away  from 0 (so, for example, round(0.5)
is 1.0 and round(-0.5) is -1.0)
Examples
>>> round(78.88, 2)
78.88
>>> round(78.88, 1)
78.9
>>> round(3.14728, 2)
3.15
